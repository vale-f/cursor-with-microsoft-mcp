This repository contains a collection of end-to-end (E2E) Playwright tests for the [OKFN website](https://okfn.org/) using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/) and the [Ashish-Bansal/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/Ashish-Bansal/playwright-mcp) plugin.
This project is just a personal experiment to explore the use of these tools and GitHub Actions.
